The goal of this essay is to is to look at the difference between what are considered "smart" questions and what are considered "not smart" questions in regards to asking for technical help on the web.  To figure this out, we will look at two specific questions pulled off of the Stack Overflow website. First will be example of the "smart" question and second the example of the "not smart" question. 

Earlier this semester, one of my professors told me that I should look into using LaTeX when I am creating math or algorithm related document. Usually I use Vim when I am writing. Since I heard that Vim happens to have a nice "LaTeX Suite", I decided to look into it on Stack Overflow and this question popped out at me as an example of a well written question. 

For this assignment, we were to read the writing by Eric Steven Raymond, called <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#rtfm">How To Ask Questions The Smart Way.</a>
