UI frameworks can be a really great thing, especially if you don't plan on spending the time to tweak your UI down to the pixel. Semantic UI and other UI frameworks give you the ability to slap together a decent looking and functioning website. It might not be exactly what you want, but if you have a lot to do, you will get over it and move on to your next project. 

If you do want to tweak you website until it is perfect, UI frameworks can still be quite helpful. They can provide the building blocks to get your website up and running 90% the way you want it quickly. Then after you have a prototype, you can start your tweaking. Also, if you plan to do work that is similar, you can even give your UI framework custom settings to be closer to what you want in the end anyway. 

So, optimally, learning something like Semantic UI or Twitter Bootstrap, can save you a lot of time and effort. The thing is, you have to put in quite a bit more time and effort learning the framework, than you would if you were to build a small website using HTML and CSS alone. It can be frustrating when the UI framework, overrides functions of your HTML and CSS, when you know that if only you weren't using that UI framework, you could make that change so easily. It is even more frustrating when the UI framework itself does not work the way that the documentation says that it should. I will never get that hour and a half of my life back trying to figure out why the "internal rail" wouldn't go on the inside like it was supposed to!
