With most frameworks designed to build web apps, one has to learn a multitude of languages to get started building real apps. In some cases you might have and Angular front end running JavaScript and then have a backend framework of something like Spring running Java with an SQL database. All together this bonding of different languages and frameworks is supposed to make life easier for you in the long run. Once you are proficient with all of these technologies and how they fit together, you will quickly and efficiently be able to make usable websites. Doing the fine tuning will of course take a bit longer no matter what framework you are using, but sometimes getting a usable site, even if it is in the beta stages is the most important part.

With Meteor, there are quite a few sticking points. One of the most frustrating ones is just how long it takes for Meteor to start running one of your projects. You might be doing a simple Hello World and meteor will still take three minutes to get it up and running. This does have to with the hardware you have it running on as well as the operating system. 

Though Meteor takes its sweet time to get itself up and running the app, it makes it easy to work on while it is running. When Meteor is running, it will automatically update the web page as soon as the changes are saved to the server. This means it is really easy to have the app up in a browser in one window and your editor up in the other window making changes and watching them come up as soon as you press ctrl s. 

It seems that Meteor is catered toward the Unix fans. Myself on Linux and my classmates running Linux or on Macs had an extremely easy time installing Meteor. They made it so it only takes a few commands from the terminal and it is all set up. However, the others on Windows had a much different experience. Those of them not yet on Windows 10 had to make the switch and some of them who could not get it running even with Windows 10 ended up switching to Linux. So I guess if they got that far, it is a win, win situation.
