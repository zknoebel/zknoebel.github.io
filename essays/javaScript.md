JavaScript seems like a good language to know. I see it everywhere and after learning Java, JavaScript has been pretty easy to pick up. Many of the syntax components are almost the same, like for instance writing a for loop. The only difference is in Java you would normally write "int i" and in JavaScript you would normally write "let i" but the small differences are easy to pick up once you see them a few times. With that being said on the surface Java and JavaScript seem very similar, but our professor keeps telling us that under the hood, they have quite a different build. He has been telling us that the way that Objects are made and used looks the same on the surface, but they are very different when you get into them.

One of the questions we were asked to answer in this essay was whether or not JavaScript is a good language from a software engineering perspective. Honestly, it is hard to say after only learning it for a week and a half. But, the fact that it is so prevalent seems to push the answer towards a yes. Hopefully throughout the next few months of the semester, I will have a much better answer to this question.

In our ICS 314 class, our professor wants us to do something called "athletic software engineering."  As far as I can tell, this means being able to code quickly and efficiently, which sounds great. I can not imagine why you would not want to do your job more efficiently, but we are approaching it in what seems to me to be a strange way.

To help us in our quest to become "athletic software engineers," we have been doing things called Work Out of the Days or WODs. This is something along the lines of getting a small problem to solve by writing a program, but instead of having it due in a day or so, the problem has to be solved in a matter of minutes. I think this is an interesting approach to learning. Maybe it will work for some people, but it does not actually come close to fitting my learning style. Even though it in itself is not a learning strategy that will work for me, it does have a lot of benefits that come with it. One, and probably the most obvious is that it gets a person used to programming in a stressful environment and under a strict deadline. This is a great skill to practice for the infamous interview "white-board coding." Another benefit, at least to the professor, is that because it is difficult, it gives students a good reason, to practice and to study.
