At the moment I am in a software engineering course at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. I am on my way towards a B.S. degree in computer science. Since this is only my third semester here, I am still quite new to the concept of software engineering. There is a lot that I hope to get out of the class and even more that I know I need to learn to successful in my field.

I have always been interested in computers. Over the past two semesters my interest in computers has deepened through learning coding. The first classes have been about Java and just the basics of Object Oriented Programming. After everything that I have learned so far, I have started to fall in love with coding. My favorite part about it is the ability to create anything you want. As long as you have an idea, you can let your creativity flow and build something that you are proud of. After being out of school for a few years, because I did not know what I wanted to do with my life, I never dreamed that I could be going to school for something that makes me super excited to go home and do my homework.
    
There are a few things I hope to learn about software engineering in the future, and if I am lucky, maybe I will learn some in this class. In my studies so far, we have been most concerned with making code that works, which is of course important, but I know that there are many more aspects that need to be added to that. The first thing that I want to become proficient at is to be able to write code that is easy for someone else to read and to understand. I know that I need to work on commenting my code better, but I think I also need to work on writing my code in smaller easy to understand pieces that are easily reusable. Often I hear talk of the DRY principal "don't repeat yourself." So, hopefully this c
lass will help to teach me to write more modular code with a focus on inversion of control.

What I am hoping to learn most from this class are the principals of creating larger pieces of software. Ones that would normally take more than one person to write. It is easy to write small programs by yourself, but it takes a lot more than just coding proficiency to write a group project. I am hoping to get a good grasp on how to organize my projects so that it is easy to work on with team members and also on how to organize my team so that the work is evenly distributed, so that the team is happy and so members that have more time to work on the code are not having to wait on the other before they can continue.

Over all, there is so much about software engineering that I still need to know, that I will be happy with whatever knowledge comes my way and I will continue to learn the rest on my own. This is one of the most fascinating subjects to me
, to I cannot wait to see what comes next.
