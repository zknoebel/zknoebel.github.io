## Overview

problem 
unwanted email about things like moped theft

solution
Make a filter for Gmail that gets rid of emails containing certain unwanted strings.

This project will use Meteor and Mongo to store user settings and strings to ignore.

The UH login will happen when the user logs in to their email and be used to access the users settings/strings.

## Mockup page ideas

mock up page

This project will be an extension for Gmail.

in example
	strings to filter out
	email addresses not to ignore
	algorithm to detect sets of words/phrases and repeating sentences

## Use case ideas

The specific use case for this would be to move all emails containing the phrase "moped theft" into "Spam" folder in Gmail.

## Beyond the Basics

Instead of just filtering to the spam folder in Gmail, the program would be able to make and track more Gmail folders and do things like add all "moped theft" emails into a mopedTheft folder. 

Add option to highlight a string and right click to add the string to the block list and/or to create a folder for the string.
