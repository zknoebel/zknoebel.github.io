This app is made to allow people with a UH username and password to find people to carpool with. The parking situation at UH is not very good. There are not enough parking spaces to accommodate all of the people who need to park. Lots of people have to take the bus, or park in the subdivisions close to school and then walk in. For the people who can get spots, there is a fee and it is hundreds of dollars per semester. Carpooling helps to solve this situation by allowing people to save gas money and parking money.

Once a user signs in, they can create a profile with their information and also look at listings from other users. They can create their own listings as well. This entails submitting a small form with their location and the times that they want to be going back and forth. Once they submit their form, other users can search for times and place that match and it will come up so other users can accept the listing. After this the users will be connected and can start carpooling together.
