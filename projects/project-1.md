At the University of Hawaii at Manoa for ICS 111 each student has to do a final project with a partner or a group. For my final project, my partner and I decided to make a 2D tank game.

The object of the game is to shoot the other tank until it explodes, before the other tank shoots your tank enough for it to explode. Both players take turns shooting and the last one standing wins. There are a few more rules added. One is that since every shot removes the ground that it hits, if a tank falls below the screen, they loose. Another is that you can get points for shooting the bird out of the sky. 

The engine used to create this game was EZ Java which is a java program developed by one of the grad students at UH Manoa.
