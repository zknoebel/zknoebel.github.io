---
This is a program written in C for the ICS212 class at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.

It is a simulation of a banking program with a command line based interface. The program gives the user the ability to create/store bank accounts, delete bank accounts and display information about the bank accounts. The accounts are stored in a .txt file. Every time the program is opened, the accounts are read from the file and put into memory in the form of a linked list. When the program is closed, the bank accounts are written back to the text file.
