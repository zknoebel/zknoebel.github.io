There is an open source project called grouper. It is used to create and organize groups of subjects. In our case subjects are normally people, usually students and staff at the various universities in the University of Hawaii system. These groups are developed and maintained by the Information Technology Systems (ITS) staff at the University of Hawaii at Maona. The idea of UH Groupings is to give some of that controll over to the various staff members in charge of the groups themseves without having to go through the ITS staff first.

UH Groupings accomplishes this by having a automatically maintained basis group and then letting the group owner controll which members to exclude and which non-members to include.
